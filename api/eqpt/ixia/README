This is a introduction file for ixia.tcl
To show test creater how to use the APIs to control IXIA

1. What's this file is used for?
   This file is a layer implemented with IXIA native API to provide useful APIs,
   To make the user to use IXIA easily. 
   Only few APIs can complete a function test with IXIA.

2. Basic usage steps of these IXIA API
    a. connect to IXIA ---->connect_ixia 
    b. config port type,fiber or copper --->config_portprop
    c. config frame on an IXIA port ---->config_frame
    d. config stream on an IXIA port ---->config_stream
    e. send traffic on an port       ---->send_traffic
    f. capture packets      ------>start_capture
    g. stop capturing on an port -->stop_capture
    h. filter packets in captured ---->check_capture

For more details please read the ixia.tcl or others test cases to learn how to use IXIA with these APIs.
